# Flashcard-for-Color-in-Spanish

This HTML document, titled "Vocabulario de colores" (Colors Vocabulary), serves as a simple interactive guide to learn colors in English and Spanish. The main page includes color names and links to individual color pages, each with a large title and background color matching the respective color. Additionally, there's a hint to click on each color to reveal more information.

The associated CSS files, such as "style.css," provide styling to enhance the visual experience. Each color has its own dedicated HTML page (e.g., "red.html," "blue.html") with a corresponding CSS file for styling (e.g., "redStyle.css," "blueStyle.css").

For example, the "blue.html" page has a blue background and a large "Blue" heading. The "blueStyle.css" file is responsible for setting the background color and styling the heading. Similarly, other color pages follow the same structure.

The main "style.css" file customizes the appearance of color titles, setting different text colors corresponding to each color. The images of the colors are linked in the main HTML file, providing a visual representation.

This project creates an engaging and visually appealing way to learn colors in both languages, utilizing HTML and CSS to enhance the user experience.
